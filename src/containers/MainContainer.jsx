// mapStateToProps is a really confusing name when you first see it, but
// what it's doing is exactly what it's named. It's taking the state from your Redux store
// and mapping it to the `props` on your component so that you can access them that way,
// without having to explicitly pass them down through the component tree (A.K.A "prop-drilling").
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  todoList: state.todos.todoList,
  totalCompleted: state.todos.totalCompleted,
});

// NOTE: You could rewrite this a bit cleaner like so using destructuring assignment:
/*
  const mapStateToProps = ({todos}) => ({
    todoList: todos.todoList,
    totalCompleted: todos.totalCompleted,
  });
*/

// mapDispatchToProps is also capable of weirding you out if you let it. It's got the same
// idea going as `mapStateToProps`, where instead of mapping state to your component's `props`,
// it maps your actions (which we've imported at the top).
// NOTE: (Something that really confused me at first was, if you look at your `actions.js`, you'll
//        notice that they literally just return objects with a `type` and a `payload`. They don't
//        actually do anything to your store or state at all, so how could invoking them do anything
//        other than return a simple object representing the action? Well, if you notice at the bottom
//        of the file, we are passing this `mapDispatchToProps` to Redux's `connect` function. What the
//        `connect` function will do is turn those action functions from functions that return simple objects
//        into functions that call `dispatch(action)` on your Redux store. The actual dispatching of actions
//        to the store is abstracted away by the React-Redux library we're using.)

  addTodo,

    //        which maps our Redux store's state and action dispatchers to our component's `props`...
    //        Another way to think about it is that Redux "injects" state and actions from our store into
    //        our component's `props` so that we can use them.)
